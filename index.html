            <div class="question">Streamline and improve the customer service experience?</div>
            <div class="answer">An FAQ page that answers your customers’ most common and basic questions can reduce the volume of repetitive inquiries your customer support team has to deal with. It’s a proactive customer service initiative that allows your customer service team to focus on more critical support issues and respond faster to customers who need help with more complex problems.</div>

            <div class="question">Increase website traffic from search engine optimization?</div>
            <div class="answer">By including lots of internal links and specific, detailed answers about your business on your FAQ page, you will improve your SEO.

            <div class="question">Lead to higher product adoption rates?</div>
            <div class="answer">A trip to your FAQ page usually indicates that a visitor is interested in learning more about your product or service. A good FAQ page will therefore bridge any knowledge gaps that a user might have about your product and help them get to their aha moment faster – helping to drive your product adoption.</div>

            <div class="question">Improve the user experience?</div>
            <div class="answer">Nearly 70% of consumers try to resolve their issues independently before reaching out to support. Therefore, compiling and organizing answers to common questions in one place benefits customers who prefer to self-serve, as they no longer have to comb through your website in search of a solution.</div>
